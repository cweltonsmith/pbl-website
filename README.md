## Images

To store a image simply place it in the image folder.
Below is an example of the html text looks likes to add an image and link to it.
Use img tag and the source of the image and image name/type in quotes. 
The style is simply adjusting the image to fit better on screen.
Alt is just what you decied to name the image in html. Note this does not change the acutal images name.

```
<img src="images/NAMEOFIMAGE.jpg" style="width:80em;height:50em;" alt="Image">
```
