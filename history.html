                    <h3>History of Nodaway County Lifeline</h3>
                </div>
            <br>
            <p class="pText">
                1983 Bonnie Williams, daughter of respected Maryville resident Inez Bowman, told her mother about an
                emergency response system that was available in Iowa City, IA. She thought her mother might be
                interested in
                the program. Inez was intrigued by the concept and brought it to the Maryville Citizens for Community
                Action
                (MCCA) for consideration. The MCCA Human Resources Task Force thought it warranted further investigation
                and
                approached St. Francis Hospital to see if they would be interested in establishing the program. The
                Hospital
                had already heard of the program and they were considering it.
                <br>
                <br>
                A committee, consisting of Martin Goedken from St. Francis Hospital, Mildred Davis, Inez Bowman and
                Donna
                Holt traveled to St. Joseph, MO to talk to the Lifeline volunteer coordinator to see how their
                organization
                operated. After this meeting the St. Francis Hospital administration decided that the funds were not
                available to buy the units necessary to begin the program. Undaunted, a group of individuals decided to
                undertake the program.
                <br>
                <br>
                Frank strong volunteered to help file the articles of incorporation that were signed by Inez Bowman as
                vice
                president, Bob Bush as president and Donna Holt as treasurer. On May 11, 1984, the Health Emergency
                Lifeline
                Program (HELP) became a not-for-profit corporation. A federal tax number was issued to the new
                organization
                on October 18, 1984. The all-volunteer organization known as, the Health Emergency Lifeline Program,
                Inc.
                was born.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first contract with Lifeline Systems, Inc., whose home office is in Massachusetts, was signed on
                June
                29, 1984. The units and new response center were shipped, and the first installation was set up for
                Wednesday, August 22, 1984 at 11:00 a.m. for Florence Zimmerman. It was quite a media event KQTV out of
                St.
                Joseph, MO and local media attending.
                <br>
                <br>
                Funding to start the program came from two large donations. The St. Francis Hospital Auxiliary donated
                $5,000 and the Business and Professional Women (BPW) donated $5,000 that had come to them from a
                bequest.
                Officers of HELP decided to lease the equipment rather than purchase it outright. This turns out to have
                been a wise decision. HELP would not have been able to expand the program if the home units and response
                center had to be purchased. At the time, individual units cost $495 and the response center $7,000.
                <br>
                <br>
                Leasing has allowed HELP to stay current with the latest technology. The life of each lease is five
                years.
                When the time period for each lease is ended, HELP’s Executive Committee seeks approval from its Board
                of
                Directors to enter a new lease for the same number, a lesser number or a greater number of units. That
                decision is driven by whether there are several names on the waiting list. With over 150 units in
                service in
                2008, the program continues to be a valuable resource for Nodaway county community members and those
                living
                in the surrounding area whose doctors utilize St. Francis Hospital and Health Services. In the summer of
                2004, the volunteers who operate the program were happy to celebrate 20 years of dedicated service and
                caring for their neighbors through the Health Emergency Lifeline Program.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2011 a transition from site monitoring at St. Francis Hospital to central monitoring from a location
                in
                Massachusetts was successfully completed. This change occurred because the site monitoring unit at St.
                Francis would become obsolete in 2012-- no longer able to be serviced. Site monitoring was free; central
                monitoring carries a monthly charge for each unit monitored. HELP has converted all program units from
                leased to owned property over the past 5 years with the return of the final leased units to Lifeline in
                February 2015. The commitment to ownership allows HELP to keep costs as affordable as possible to our
                Nodaway County subscribers.
                <br>
                <br>
                HELP current inventory has declined due to the discontinuance of the first digital units (DT 1000) and
                rollovers, we currently have an inventory of 88 units which includes the addition of cellular based
                units.
                HELP still has some DT 1000s in use and are gradually replacing them as they fail to work. Future
                purchases
                will include both landline (6900 Model Units) and cellular (7000 Series Units) communicators. In
                addition,
                there are units now being used that are mobile and do not use a base communicator. Communication is all
                through the button.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since 1984, HELP has served 1,155 subscribers as of 2019. Of the current subscribers, 78 have had
                Lifeline
                between one to ten years; 6 have had Lifeline over ten years of which 2 subscribers have received
                services
                for more than 15 years. Remaining in the security and comfort of their own home has been a reality for
                these
                valued members of our community.

                <ul class="pText">
                    <li>1983 – Inez Bowman brought the idea of Lifeline to the attention of the community group known
                        as the “Maryville Citizens for Community Action”.</li>
                    <li>May 1984 – Health Emergency Lifeline Program, Inc. was officially incorporated. HELP formed as
                        a not-for-profit, all-volunteer organization in the St. Francis Hospital service region. The
                        program is site monitored with all units leased.</li>
                    <li>The first 12 units were installed beginning in August 1984.</li>
                    <li>March of 1986, the founder of Lifeline Systems, Inc., Dr. Andrew Dibner, visited Maryville.</li>
                    <li>The Health Emergency Lifeline Program received a grant from Lifeline Systems (through the
                        efforts of Dr. Dibner) in the amount of $4,000 for writing a “manual” entitled, “Forming an
                        All-Volunteer Lifeline Program” which was submitted in December 1986.</li>
                    <li>In 1987 Bob Bush, first HELP president, served on the planning committee for the Lifeline
                        systems national conference held in Kansas City, Missouri.</li>
                    <li>HELP has grown to as many as 181 leased units; leasing allows the program to offer the most
                        up-to-date technology to its subscribers.</li>
                    <li>St. Francis Hospital and Health Services provided personnel to monitor the RC500 response
                        unit, free of charge to the program 365 days a year, 24 hours a day to 2010.</li>
                    <li>In 2010, due to the high cost of replacing the RC500 response unit, HELP joined the Central
                        Monitoring Program provided by Philips Lifeline.</li>
                    <li>Beginning in 2010, HELP began a transition to purchased units while continuing to lease to
                        subscribers. This process was completed in February 2015</li>
                    <li>In 2011 a transition from site monitoring at St. Francis Hospital to central monitoring from a
                        location in Boston, Massachusetts was successfully completed. </li>
                    <li>In 2010, after 27 years of volunteering, Donna Holt transitioned to a more limited role. In
                        2013/14, Nancy Baxter (28 yrs.) and Dr. Bob Bush (30 yrs.) relocated to be closer to their
                        children. Barbara York, a retired Public Health RN and founding member, remains actively
                        involved.</li>
                    <li>The monthly lease cost to subscribers is reasonable and considerably less than similar
                        programs operated throughout the United States. Installation and site monitoring are free. Only
                        the cost of monitoring from Philips Lifeline and minimal administrative costs are included in
                        the monthly fee. Keeping costs low is an important feature of the HELP program.</li>
                    <li>HELP has consistently received funding from the local United Way and various service groups
                        throughout the county to provide units to subscribers with modest means.</li>
                    <li>HELP has been with Lifeline for over three decades of its history. </li>
                    <li>Between 1984 and 2019, HELP has served 1,155 subscribers. Remaining in the security and comfort
                        of their own home has been a reality for these valued members of our community.</li>
